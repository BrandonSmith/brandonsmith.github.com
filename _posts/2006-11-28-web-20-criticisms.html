<p>There are several criticisms about Web 2.0 going around lately on various blogs, including the <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/11/25/forward_to_the_distributed_revolution/">Register</a>...</p> <p>I disagree. Kathy Sierra put it nicely in her post on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/11/why_web_20_is_m.html">Why Web 2.0 is more than a buzzword</a>. The criticisms are from intelligent people. This is not just the Web 2.0 hatemongering in days, months, year past. These are well-informed criticisms.</p> <p>Kathy explains that there is a difference between elitism and experts. I believe there is a lot of elitism in Web 2.0. Especially the marketing side. However, there is a strong claim that the aggregate technologies, social software and software as a service is changing the way businesses can serve and profit from customers.</p>
