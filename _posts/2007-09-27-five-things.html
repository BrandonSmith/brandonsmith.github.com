<p>I was <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Five_Things">tagged</a> by Joe Gregorio. A very long time ago. At the time my motive was to stop the viral madness. But, in sweeping out my drafts folder, I figured why not post the five things without 'tagging' anyone else:</p>  <ol>   <li>I lived in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-29.276816,30.440369&amp;spn=1.741687,2.900391&amp;t=h&amp;z=9&amp;om=1&amp;msid=117621609987943563644.00043afa1d37fbe490c80">Durban, South Africa</a> from 1997 to 1999 serving a mission for my <a href="http://www.lds.org">church</a>. I'm saddened that many of the life-long friendships I made there have already ended in the 8 years since due to the AIDS crisis in South Africa. It really is a tragedy.</li>    <li>I have the most amazing wife and mother of my two children of 3 years and 9 months.</li>    <li>I lack the confidence that many exhibit in this industry. This explains why many of my thoughts never get to this blog. I just need to write confidently.</li>    <li>I like being the center of attention on my own terms. For example, I can be annoyingly outgoing in one setting only to appear extremely shy in another.</li>    <li>I played bass guitar in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Before+Braille">Before Braille</a>, a now <a href="http://www.beforebraille.com">defunct rock band</a>. Toured our little hearts out but couldn't make a dent in the music industry. We opened for <a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/">Jimmy Eat World</a>, the Used, and the Format, among others. It was a lot of fun and, if anything, touring months on end taught me that I wanted the married life. </li> </ol>
