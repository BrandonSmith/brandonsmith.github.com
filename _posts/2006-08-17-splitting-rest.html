<p>I talk a lot about REST. You can probably guess what my day-to-day is like. Get used to it.</p> <p>There is a <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog">Mark</a> vs. <a href="http://markclittle.blogspot.com/2006/08/mac-os-versus-windows-and-their.html">Mark</a> (gentle) <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2006/08/13/the-unsittable-fence/">debate about REST, SOA, and WS-*</a>. (Hint: look at the comments...insightful).</p> <blockquote> <p>As for REST vs. SOA versus REST vs WS-*, I chose the former (despite noticing you using the latter) because you canâ€™t really compare an architectural style to a set of specifications.</p></blockquote>
