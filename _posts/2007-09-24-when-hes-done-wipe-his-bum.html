<p>Isn't <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/WebBeansSneakPeekPartIIntroducingWebBeans">Web Beans</a> not just a little embarrassing, but an extremely painful admission for the Java world? Do not read this as an attack on Web Beans itself, but the implications represented by its mere existence. What problems is it solving? It is a solution for JEE 5's current complexity, which was (JPA in particular) drastically re-engineered from its previous iteration. So it provides a unification API for existing APIs, which was an abstraction of previous APIs, and so on. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Isn't this a bit like grasping for straws when the only straws left are the short ones. Arriving far after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny,_meeny,_miny,_moe">'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'</a> has already pardoned a few. The community is left to deal with the grand unified results, only to face another abstraction a year later because the current API isn't 'simple' enough.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_was_an_Old_Woman_Who_Lived_in_a_Shoe">another nursery rhyme</a>. Even a leather shoe is edible with enough boiling and gravy. But that doesn't mean you should eat it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.<br />She had so many children, she didn't know what to do.<br />She gave them some broth without any bread,<br />Then whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm, interpretation is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
