I'll be attending OSCON next week. This will be my first conference working for IBM. It will be different attending the event from something different than an academic mindset. However, my position with IBM allows for more research and prototyping than a typical developer position.

I'd love to meet up with other OSCON attendees.

Check out my schedule and let me know if you any suggestions to help me decide which session to attend.
