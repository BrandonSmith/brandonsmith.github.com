Elias makes an interesing point about tagging and folksonomy. Typically tagging's shortcomings can be categorized into false positives and false negatives.

The false positives are obvious. The false negatives are somewhat more subtler. Not everyone has the same folksonomy. This is both the boon and bane of folksonomy. The boon is those with similar folksonomy can find each other and benefit from like-minded categorization. The bane is that they have to find each other.
