UPDATE: It seems Network Solutions has turned off their search "feature" where they register the domain you just searched.

<del datetime="2008-01-15T12:38:00+00:00">Here is a fun little experiment...

<ol>
	<li>Do a search for a random domain on <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a>. I chose <code>networksolutionsactuallyregisterseverydomainsearched.com</code>. If the domain has been taken, think of another one.</li>
	<li>Then go to <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/index.jsp">Network Solutions</a> and do the search on the same domain. Note that the domain is still available.</li>
	<li>Now go back to GoDaddy.com and search one more time.</li>
</ol>

Hmmm. Seems Network Solutions searches are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent">idempotent</a>.
