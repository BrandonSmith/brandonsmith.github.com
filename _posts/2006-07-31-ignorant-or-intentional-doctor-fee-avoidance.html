<p>One of my favorite blogs, "Get Rich Slowly", has a post asking why doctors don't know their own fees.</p>

<p>I has a near identical experience several months ago which culminated in a letter to Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina. I was exasperatingly frustrated, and still am. In fact, I asked my wife only today if she would call the doctor's offices of some appointments we have (dentist, regular check ups, etc.) in the coming weeks because I know how frustrated I get.</p>

<p>My situation several months ago started with a simple question..."How much is this going to cost me?" Nobody could tell me. I was sent on a wild goose chase from billing to billing, just trying to get a ballpark. I have a budget, you know. I like to plan several weeks out. I don't like getting surprises after the matter.</p>

<p>But I believe the medical industry pries on the very fact knowledge asymetry. Doctors, by virtue of being doctors, know more than their patients. Otherwise, why would you go see a doctor. If I can stitch up that hemoraging cut myself, I'll do it. If I can get rid of colon cancer, I would.</p>

<p>I don't believe it is entirely the doctors' fault. Their fee is pretty basic. It is a combination of insurance, doctors out sourcing their billing, and not enough patients demanding more transparency.</p>

<p>So the question begs whether doctors intentially keep patients ignorant or are they ignorant themselves of total medical costs?<br />
