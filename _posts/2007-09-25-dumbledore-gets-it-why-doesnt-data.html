<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>. One of my favorite features is &quot;Revisions&quot;: when a file is saved, an immutable state or versioned is saved and can be recalled. With a simple drop down box, I can restore a previous version.</p>  <p>Later, I'm talking with my brother-in-law about upcoming features of Mac OS X 10.5. And we spend a good deal of time postulating how <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> will change the world. (If you haven't checked out the UI twist on a fairly standard storage backup infrastructure.</p>  <p>The other night, I finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. (Loved it, by the way). In this final chapter of Harry's tragic teenage angst, Harry brings us with him in to <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pensieve">the Pensieve</a> just as he did in previous books to learn of critical plot details by 'experiencing' firsthand other people's memories. A proxied flashback, if you will.</p>  <p>And then it hits me.</p>  <p>Why isn't all data modeled to be versioned? This universe we live in has one constant, we are on a linear timeline. (Yeah, yeah. Relativistic effects. But as far as I know, science has yet to coerce time to reverse, much less stand still.) Versions, memories, immutable state, what have you. We experience life as a series of observations. Conjuring a 'view' of those observations is a 'memory'. It seems so entwined with our very nature that it seems like major oversight that all data is not versioned.</p>
