I want an iPad. And I'll probably get one at some point. Being busy at <a href="http://phonebooth.com">work</a>, I didn't really track pre-orders, the exact launch date, etc. Today's release actually came quicker than I thought it would. 

But wait. The <strong><em>real</em></strong> wireless version comes out later this month? Kind of glad I missed it as our family likes road trips.  

Isn't getting the iPad today like rushing out to buy the new Prius model that gets 50 MPG only to have the 75 MPG one come out several weeks later?
