Last month, my team started a new practice... the team "hack-a-thon". It
basically consisted of the following rules:

  - Teams of three to five
  - Two days
  - Work on anything you want
  - Prepare for a brief demo on the third day
  - Go

We had great executive buy-in. Most of the presentations were attended by David
Morken (CEO), Chris Chuang (COO), and Jim Mulcahy (Republic SVP). They
view this new, periodic practice as vital to our engineering culture and
long-term ability to produce innovative products.

For me, it was a blast.
