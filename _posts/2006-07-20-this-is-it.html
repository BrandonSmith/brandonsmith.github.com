<p>And here we go. I have things to say...they're going to get said. This is a blog primarily about my interests. Technology, life, and family.</p>

<p>Mostly about the stuff I'm currently researching and prototyping for my job with IBM. Clearly never any specifics, etc. about such projects, but enough depth and to wet your taste to come back. Heck, you may even subscribe.</p>

<p>So, without further adieu...16cards.</p>
