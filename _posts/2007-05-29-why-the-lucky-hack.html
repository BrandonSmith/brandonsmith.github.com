<p>So <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">'why the lucky stiff'</a> has revealed the <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/hacketyOrg.html">latest project</a>, which is the culmination of several projects. Clearly impressed with <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/">everything from why</a>, <a href="http://hackety.org/">Hackety Hack</a> deeply resonates with me. Having my first programming epiphony implementing the de facto 'tic tac toe' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> for my brothers to play with, why is providing the same for a new generation.</p> <p>From Hackety Hack...</p> <blockquote> <p>In the 1980s, a language called BASIC swept the countryside. It was a language <strong>beginners could use</strong> to make their computer speak, play music. You could easily draw a big smiley face or a panda or whatever you like! But not just BASIC. Other languages like: LOGO and Pascal were <strong>right there</strong> on many computers.</p> <p>In this century, you may have dozens of programming languages lurking on your machine. But how to use them?? A fundamental secret! Well, no more. <strong>We cannot stand for that.</strong> Hackety Hack will not stand to have you in the dark!!</p></blockquote>
