<p><a href="http://contekst.org/blog/?p=21">contekst.org &#xBB; Blog Archive &#xBB; Why did Java succeed ?</a> </p>  <blockquote>I have a sneaking suspicion that existing customer sets will not replace Java, there is way too much invested in the language, the libraries, the VM and in J2EE application servers. The change has to come from a new customer set.</blockquote>  <p>Not only new customer sets, but new classes of applications.</p>  <p>Ruby on Rails, in my opinion, is the crowning achievement after nearly a decade of thinking in terms of the Model View Controller design pattern. There is no doubt that smart conventions + ActiveRecord (and other nicities) do, in reality, enable an agile development experience.</p>  <p>However, the real reality is that the M in MVC almost always means relational database without much thought. So much data</p>
