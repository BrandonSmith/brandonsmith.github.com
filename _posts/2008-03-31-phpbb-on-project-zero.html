Somehow this flew under my radar. Sad, considering I am on the project. Project Zero is starting to become self-hosted (to the extent it makes sense, of course) with its own <a href="https://www.projectzero.org/forum/index.php">support forum running phpBB on the Project Zero runtime itself</a>.

So I went and dug deeper...

Back in January, <a href="http://www.projectzero.org/blog/index.php/2008/01/13/phpbb-running-on-project-zero/">Rob Nicholson</a> and <a href="http://www.projectzero.org/blog/index.php/2008/01/24/running-phpbb-from-the-project-zero-commandline/">Iain Lewis</a> posted that phpBB now runs on Project Zero's PHP runtime.

Getting a major PHP application, such as phpBB, running on Project Zero's PHP runtime implemented in Java is quite impressive. But as I dug deeper, I came across a blog post from just a few days ago. SugarCRM is also running on Project Zero. That's huge!!
