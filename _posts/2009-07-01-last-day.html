After nearly four years with IBM, the day has arrived. My final day with IBM as my employer.

During my time at IBM I found the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/social/projects_bluemail.html">BlueMail to be the most usable email and calendar client</a>. I religiously tagged all my saved emails.

And so I generated a tag cloud of all my emails. I think it is pretty indicative of what's itching my brain during my IBM tenure:
