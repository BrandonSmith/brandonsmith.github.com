<p>There is no <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/">silver bullet</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no such thing as a single Enterprise wide tool for any company of reasonable complexity and its plain silly to believe that the next technology wave will be any different from previous ones in terms of delivering on the promise of the "one ring to bind them" vision of ERP/EAI/EDM/ESB.</p></blockquote>
