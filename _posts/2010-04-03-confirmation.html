There is a strange emotion that we humans have. A need for confirmation. That our life is important. That what we do day to day has meaning to others. To others whether we are close or unknown.

Often, I find myself pondering and carrying such emotions.

Other times, I will stare at my computer screen and watch my Domino's pizza order <strong><em>virtually</em></strong> be baked by Raymond.
