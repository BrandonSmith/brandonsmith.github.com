In a past life I was an avid ColdFusion developer from 1998 to 2004. In fact, it was the transition from ColdFusion implemented atop of J2EE that got me into Java. I had opportunity on several occations to provide feedback on Allaire and then Macromedia about features and enhancements.

One feature I suggested for the current CFMX 7 release that would be useful to enterprise class performance requirements is the ability to spawn worker threads. I even created a sample tag CF_THREAD to show how it could be done. Feedback from Macromedia was that the <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?do=blog.entry&entry=E0816725-0D6B-FE94-A7213B935DDC7679">Event Gateway</a> was the focus of asynchronous behavior in the release.

As such, it is interesting to see this come across the Adobe blogs...
