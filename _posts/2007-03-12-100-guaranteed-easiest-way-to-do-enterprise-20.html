<p>This rings very true. In my opinion, IBM does&nbsp;a fairly <a href="http://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html">good job</a> of staying out&nbsp;getting out of&nbsp;the way. In fact, a lot of&nbsp;the internal community tool innovation going on&nbsp;over the last few years is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=590">surfacing</a> as <a href="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/connections">Lotus Connections</a>, which will enable enterprises with social tools. However,&nbsp;no amount of money can purchase a culture, which grows organically.&nbsp;Paraphrasing (former IBMer) Don Ferguson, "if you stand in the way of the Internet, it will run you over."
